# image-orientator
Auto Orientate Images using embedded EXIF information.

The purpose of this project is to create a simple, easy to use Java API library that will auto-orientate images based on the embedded EXIF information.

Because of the necessities of developing / testing this library, and the environment within which I am working, this project is being developed as an IBM XPages application template. 

HOWEVER - that does not mean the library code itself is unusable outside of an XPages environment.  The library code itself is pure Java and will have no dependencies on an of the IBM XPages runtime libraries.   After initial development and testing is complete, I plan on extracting the library (and any relevent required libraries) from the NTF template and making it available as a pure eclipse java project.
